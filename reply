Subject: Re: [PATCH] Bluetooth: hci_event: Fix HCI_EV_VENDOR max_len

Hi

I've only just noticed this patch solves my issue

https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20220125144639.2226-1-mike@fireburn.co.uk/

Can it be added to stable too?

My patch can then be ignored:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/bluetooth/patch/20220312164550.1810665-1-mike@fireburn.co.uk/

Thanks

Mike
