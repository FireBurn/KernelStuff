Subject: Re: [PATCH] mt76: mt7921e: fix possible probe failure after reboot

Hi

I get a BUG and the kernel resuses to boot with this patch when mt76 is compiled into the kernel

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214557

I don't see this issue when mt76 is compiled as a module

My .config is at https://github.com/FireBurn/KernelStuff/blob/master/dot_config_tip

Let me know if you'd like any more info

Cheers

Mike
